問17  
W: Hey, what’s wrong?  
M: I left my wallet on the train.  
W: Oh no, that’s terrible!  
M: Luckily, I remembered which car I was in and reported it immediately. I got my wallet back later and nothing was missing.  
W: Isn’t that good?  
M: Yeah, but it’s scary to think that somebody might have all my information.
